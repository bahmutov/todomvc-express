> TodoMVC with server-side rendering

Live demo at [todomvc-express.herokuapp.com/](https://todomvc-express.herokuapp.com/) -
might be asleep, wait 10 seconds. Does not permanently store todos; they disappear when
the dyno goes to sleep.

Complete server-side rendering for TodoMVC using [ExpressJS](http://expressjs.com/)
server and [virtual-dom](https://github.com/Matt-Esch/virtual-dom).

In fact, NO client side
JavaScript is allowed using
[Content Security Policy](https://glebbahmutov.com/blog/disable-inline-javascript-for-security/)
setting in the page "meta" tag (view page source). You can disable JavaScript in your browser
and the page will still work just fine.

Any new todo, or click leads to the form submission and new page rendering.

## Use

You can clone this repo and start the server locally

    npm start

The open `localhost:3000` to play with the application. Local data is saved in `todos.json`.
The Express server itself is defined in file [src/app.js](src/app.js) that you can reuse from
other environments

## Related

I have written a couple of modules that help with TodoMVC applications.

* [virtual-todos](https://github.com/bahmutov/virtual-todos) - generates Virtual Dom from todos
* [fake-todos](https://github.com/bahmutov/fake-todos) to generate fake todo items
* [todomvc-model](https://github.com/bahmutov/todomvc-model) is the model that keeps
  todo items and responds to outside events
* [instant-vdom-todo](https://github.com/bahmutov/instant-vdom-todo) - instant web app
  using ServiceWorker

## Emit

The returned Express app is also an event emitter. Every data update it
emits the updated todo list.

```js
const app = require('todomvc-express')
app.on('todos', function (todos) {
  console.log('server has new %d todos', todos.length)
  // each todo object has {what, done, id} like this
  /*
    { what: 'new todo',
       done: false,
       id: '43e63255-5582-4f6f-85c2-dc2e85e44ffb' }
  */
})
```

## Caching

I have added a level of in-memory caching, see [src/cache.js](src/cache.js). Instead of calling `db` methods directly, like `db.loadTodos()` the app code goes through the cache methods, that have same API as db. To better show caching, I slowed down the `db.loadTodos` to take 1 second.
